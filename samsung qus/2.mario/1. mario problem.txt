Given a 2D matrix of size n*n containing 0 and 1. 0 denotes air ,1 denotes land. Mario is currently stands at (n,1)(row no. n, column no. 1). There is coin at (x,y).
 Mario can climb to upper rows or move back to lower rows using ladder.
 Mario can also move horizontaly if adjacent cell contains 1.
 Mario needs to choose minimum length ladder to reach the coin.
 find that minimum length of ladder.
NOTE: last row of matrix always contains 1
(x,y) always contains 1
use 1-based indexing

Input Format

1st line contains n(size of matrix)
next n rows each containing n column( denotes air or land)
last row contains (x,y)(coordinate of coin)

Constraints

1<=n<=50
1<=x<=50
1<=y<=50

Output Format

print minimum length ladder
