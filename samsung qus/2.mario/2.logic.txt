here n is 50
so even O(n^4 ) will paas

logic:
as n is 50 ,max legth of ladder choose will also be 49
so first we try to reach that point(that contain gold) with ladder of 0
length then with 1 length ans similarly upto n-1 (once we reach that point break the loop)

so now we have a variable length tht denotes max vertical climb we can

apply dfs from starting point
we can move horizontally freely if there is land
for vertical climbing with the ladder of length x we can climb(i+1,i+2..i+x,i-1,i-2,...i-x)
