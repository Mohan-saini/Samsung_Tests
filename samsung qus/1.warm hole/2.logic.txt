# maximum no. of holes are 5 so total number of points are 10(both ends of hole)
+ 2 more points(1 starting point 1 destination point)
# total number of points 2*n+2

#algo use: floyd warshall (very easy)( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-16-floyd-warshall-algorithm/  )
try dry run of any small example  or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwJdNfdLF9s

# point number 1 denote staring point and 2*n+2 denote destination point 
rest 2*n points are for both ends of tunnel

#now simple apply floyd warshall logic(same ditto code )
