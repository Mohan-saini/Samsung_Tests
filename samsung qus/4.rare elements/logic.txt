for each rare element apply bfs.so that we can have shortest distance
of each point (i,j)from that rare element

# suppose dp[1][i][j]-> shortest distance of point (i,j) from 
1st rare element

dp[2][i][j]->shortest distance of point (i,j) from 
2nd rare element

finally find the minimum values from (maximum value of dp[1][i][j],dp[2][i][j]..)
