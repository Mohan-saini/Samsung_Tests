A Research team want to establish a research center in a region 
where they found some rare-elements. They want to make it closest
to all the rare-elements as close as possible so that they can 
reduce overall cost of research over there. It is given that all
 the rare-element’s location is connected by roads. 
 It is also given that Research Center can only be build on road. 
 Team decided to assign this task to a coder. 
 If you feel you have that much potential.. 

Here is the Task :- Find the shortest of the longest distance of research
 center from given locations of rare-elements. 

Locations are given in the matrix cell form where 1 represents roads and
0 no road.. 
Number of rare-element and their location was also given(number<=5) 
and order of square matrix was less than equal to (20).
