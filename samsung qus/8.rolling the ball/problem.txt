1. you are given a 2D matrix. from a coordinate(i,j) we can go to any of 4
adjecent point (only 4 direction) if value at that adjecent cell has less value
than the value of (i,j). so possible we can move to all 4 direction or may be none
of direction. so you can start from any coordinate. you need to find 
maximum distance you can travel.

2.  you are given a 2D matrix. from a coordinate(i,j) we can go to that
adjecent point (only 4 direction) if value at that adjecent cell is less than
the value of (i,j)&& out of these adjecent cell you need to choose minimum 
value cell . so we can move to only 1 direction or may be none
of direction. so you can start from any coordinate. you need to find 
maximum distance you can travel.
